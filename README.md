As a senior data analyst, I am tasked to analyze a drug regimen treatment study performed on mice for skin cancer. The data resulting from the 45 days study are compiled in the following two files.
•	Mouse_metadata.csv
•	Study results.csv
Utilizing the files, I will generate tables and figures for the technical report of the clinical study which has a focus of comparing the performance of Pymaceuticals’ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.
Below is the table of content for the Analysis:
